- In all interactions be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

## Plans

- At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any.
- When the requested task at hand is big, I prefer breaking down the to do's list into multiple phases.
- When planning for multiple phases, it is extremely important for the phases to be designed in such a way that I can test and validate the successful conclusion of each phase myself.
- When plans are approved, persist it and its todos in context files so any agent can pick up the plan itself and the development stage where it left off. Let me know where you placed it.
- When a plan is fully finished, you can remove the persisted plan file from context.

## Development
- When developing phases of a plan separated into multiple phases, don't implement all phases at once. Do it phase by phase so that we can incrementally develop and I can validate each phase results myself individually (and perform manual changes if needed). Always ask for my validation before continuing the development to the next phase.
- After every new development, make sure /.claude/CONTEXT.md is up to date.
